        <p> Bubble tea—also known as pearl milk tea, bubble milk tea, tapioca milk tea, boba tea, or simply boba —is a tea-based beverage that typically features chewy tapioca pearls, milk, and flavorings. It first emerged in Taiwan during the early 1980s[1][2] and later spread to regions with sizable East Asian diaspora communities.

            While the classic version is made with tapioca pearls (often referred to as "boba" or "balls"), bubble tea can also be prepared with various other toppings like grass jelly, aloe vera, red bean, and popping boba. There is a wide range of styles and flavors available, but the most popular variants remain pearl black milk tea and pearl green milk tea, with the term "pearl" highlighting the signature tapioca balls at the bottom. </p>
